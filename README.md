# COREWAR

Description
Welcome to Corewar! This project is part of the curriculum at Epitech and is an exciting endeavor that combines coding skills with creativity and strategy. Corewar is a programming game where players write small programs called warriors that compete for control of a virtual computer system.

The game revolves around a simulated computer, called the "core." The core consists of a memory array and a set of registers. Each warrior's program is loaded into the core's memory, and they are executed simultaneously. The objective is to eliminate all opposing warriors by overwriting their instructions or causing them to execute invalid instructions.

Project Structure
The Corewar project is divided into two main parts:

Assembler (asm): This component is responsible for compiling human-readable warrior programs into machine code that the virtual machine can understand. The assembler reads a file written in the Corewar assembly language and generates a binary file that represents the warrior's program.

Virtual Machine (vm): The virtual machine is the environment where the compiled warrior programs are executed. It emulates the core, manages the warriors' execution, and determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

Installation
To use Corewar, follow these steps:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Molaryy/Corewar
